# UK Employment Data Analysis

This project analyzes employment data in the UK, focusing on unemployment trends across different industries and regions. Using **Tableau**, we have created interactive visualizations to explore and compare unemployment statistics effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset includes employment figures across various industries in the UK, focusing on changes between **2011 and 2014**. The key attributes in the dataset are:

- **Year**: The recorded year of employment data (2011 or 2014).
- **Industry**: The sector in which employment is categorized (e.g., Manufacturing, Retail, Healthcare, IT, etc.).
- **Region**: The geographical region in the UK (e.g., London, Scotland, North West, etc.).
- **Employment Change**: The increase or decrease in employment within an industry between 2011 and 2014.
- **Employment Change (%)**: The percentage increase or decrease in employment within an industry between 2011 and 2014.
- **Employment Growth (+/-)**: A positive figure indicates an **increase in employment**, while a negative figure represents a **decline in employment** within a sector.

## Objectives

The primary goal of this analysis is to **compare employment trends** in the UK using Tableau visualizations:

1. **employment Rate by Industry** – Analyzing which industries have the highest and lowest unemployment rates.
2. **employment Rate by Region** – Identifying regional differences in unemployment trends.
3. **Year-over-Year Trends** – Understanding how unemployment has changed over time across different industries and regions.

## Tableau Visualizations

### 1. **Unemployment by Industry**
   - **Visualization Used**: Bar Chart
   - **Purpose**: Shows unemployment rates for different industries, helping identify sectors with high job losses.

### 2. **Unemployment by Region**
   - **Visualization Used**: Heat Map
   - **Purpose**: Highlights regional disparities in unemployment levels across the UK.

### 3. **Yearly Unemployment Trends**
   - **Visualization Used**: Horizontal bar, map chart, stacked bar, symbol map.
   - **Purpose**: Tracks how unemployment rates have changed over time.

## How to Use the Tableau Dashboard

1. **Open Tableau Desktop**.
2. **Load the dataset** (`uk_employment_data.csv`).
3. **Connect the data** and create Pivot Tables if necessary.
4. **Use Filters** to view unemployment trends by industry, region, and year.
5. **Interact with the Visualizations**:
   - Click on different industries/regions to see detailed insights.
   - Adjust filters to compare unemployment data across years.

## Example Insights

- **Retail and Hospitality sectors** show higher unemployment rates, especially post-2020.
- **London and North East regions** tend to have higher unemployment compared to South East and South West.
- **Manufacturing jobs** have seen a decline in employment over the past decade.

## Installation & Requirements

To replicate this analysis, you will need:
- **Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public** (download from [Tableau’s official website](https://www.tableau.com/)).
- The dataset (`uk_employment_data.csv`).
- A basic understanding of Tableau for creating visualizations.

## Conclusion

This project highlights unemployment trends across industries and regions in the UK using **Tableau visualizations**. By analyzing these insights, policymakers and businesses can better understand job market trends and take informed decisions.
